# Changelog

All notable changes to the `autonomous-loop` plugin are documented here.

## v0.1.15 — 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **slice-linker split (Tier B-8)**: extracted the crew-CLI bridge into
  `scripts/lib/slice-linker/crew-bridge.mjs` (216 lines). Exports
  `tryWriteCostReport`, `writeCrewFinalSynthesis`, `writeCrewHandoff`.
  slice-linker.mjs is now 330 lines (was 471). Public API unchanged.
- **phase-gate split (Tier B-8)**: extracted command/stage runners into
  `scripts/lib/phase-gate/runners.mjs` (185 lines). Exports `nowIso`,
  `runStageList`, `runSingleStage`, `runAspireStage`. phase-gate.mjs
  is now 338 lines (was 444). `runPhaseGate` public API unchanged.

Tests: 142/142 pass.

## v0.1.14 — 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **Tooling**: ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier 3 added. CI now runs
  `npm ci`, `validate-manifests`, `lint`, `format:check`, tests. New
  `package.json` (devDependencies only) + `package-lock.json`.
- **Code style swept**: prettier --write across `scripts/**/*.mjs` and
  `tests/**/*.mjs`; no semantic changes.
- **CLI registry refactor** (`scripts/autonomous-loop.mjs`):
  - 24 hand-written `if (value === "--foo") { ... }` flag branches
    collapsed into a single `FLAG_SPEC` table.
  - 17-branch command `else if` chain collapsed into a `COMMANDS`
    registry. Lazy imports stay per-handler (cheap startup).
  - File size: 536 → 476 lines (-60).

### Fixed
- `scripts/lib/frontmatter.mjs`: redundant escape `\[` removed inside
  YAML-unsafe character class (ESLint `no-useless-escape`).
- `tests/loop-installer.test.mjs`: aligns happy-path assertion with the
  post-`feat(install): split HARD RULES` template layout — HARD RULES
  summary stays in CLAUDE.md; full rules text lives at
  `.claude/autonomous-loop/rules.md`.

## v0.1.13 — 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- `slice-linker::findHeroCrewCli` no longer hard-codes
  `crew/0.1.0/scripts/crew.mjs` in its fallback list. Now delegates to
  the shared plugin-cache discovery (`findCrewCli` from
  `plugin-identity.mjs`), which finds the newest installed version.
- Removed the absolute Windows path `C:/work/mega/hero-crew/...` from
  the dev fallback list.

### Added
- `scripts/validate-manifests.mjs`: CI step verifying required fields,
  semver parseability, and `marketplace.json` ↔ `plugin.json` version
  alignment.
- CI: validate-manifests runs before tests.
- README: test / release / license badges.

### Requires
- `crew` plugin >= v0.1.12 (unchanged — no new crew CLI surface is
  required by this release).

## v0.1.12 — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Install non-idempotency: orphan start markers no longer stack on re-install.

### Added — recent
- `slice-linker`: emit hero-crew `cost-report` on slice complete.
- Synergy Cat 3+4: claims sync, unified stop conditions, workflow state
  unification, memory + synthesis.

### Requires
- `crew` plugin >= v0.1.12.

### Infrastructure
- CI: `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` on push/PR (GitHub Actions).
- README documents marketplace install commands and pins crew version.
