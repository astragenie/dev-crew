# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: A

Target slice: **FEAT036 SLICE33**
Cost: $22.9824 · duration 3.3 min · cache hit 99.5% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $3.72
- p75 $: $6.15
- median cache hit: 99.4%
- median Opus share: 0.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 100.0% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [MEDIUM] compaction
- 1 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 5.0:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

## Cross-slice trends
### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $22.9824 is 274% above the last-3 median of $6.1470.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.
