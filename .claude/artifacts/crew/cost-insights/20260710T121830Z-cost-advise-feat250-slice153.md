# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: F

Target slice: **FEAT250 SLICE153**
Cost: $3230.8404 · duration 10168.1 min · cache hit 98.5% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $10.30
- p75 $: $35.83
- median cache hit: 98.3%
- median Opus share: 24.5%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 94.5% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [HIGH] file-rereads
- 125 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [HIGH] subagent-overuse
- 140 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] compaction
- 30 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 4.0:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [HIGH] compaction-cascade
- 30 compactions + 140 subagent dispatches — context overflow driven by excessive dispatching.
- **Suggested action:** Each subagent cold-starts the cache; the lead's context grows with each handoff read. Target ≤3 dispatches per slice. Bundle review + validation when scope is small. Write checkpoint handoffs at ≥3 compactions instead of dispatching more agents.

## Cross-slice trends
### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $3230.8404 is 31256% above the last-3 median of $10.3036.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.
