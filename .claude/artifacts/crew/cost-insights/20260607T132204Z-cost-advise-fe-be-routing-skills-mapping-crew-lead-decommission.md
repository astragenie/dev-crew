# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: C

Target slice: **FE/BE routing + skills mapping + crew:lead decommission**
Cost: $42.4587 · duration 8.9 min · cache hit 99% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $26.91
- p75 $: $30.58
- median cache hit: 99.7%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 97.9% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-overuse
- 5 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [MEDIUM] compaction
- 1 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 0.0% of spend ($0.00 of $42.46) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 3 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] subagent-creep
- Subagent dispatch count has grown across the last 3 slices: 0 → 1 → 5. Each cold-start re-derives session context.
- **Suggested action:** Bundle review + validation into a single subagent when scope is small. Reserve parallel dispatches for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $42.4587 is 39% above the last-3 median of $30.5760.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.

### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
